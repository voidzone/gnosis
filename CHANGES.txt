    The initial release for Cataclysm.
    Fixed:
    Replaced InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory with LibStub("AceConfigRegistry-3.0"):NotifyChange for the Cataclysm client, meaning now the options panel properly refreshes after element deletion.
    
    The LibDialog-1.0 librariy is currently broken due to StaticPopup_DisplayedFrames is no longer public, breaking all popup windows in the options panel. This is a known issue and devs are working on it but in the meantime I will upload a separate Gnosis build (off version control) with the hotfix included so the settings arent unusable.
